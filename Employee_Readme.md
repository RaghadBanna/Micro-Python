# Employee Attrition Analysis

This Python project analyzes employee attrition data to gain insights into factors contributing to employee turnover. The project utilizes the Pandas library for data manipulation and analysis, and Matplotlib for data visualization.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including features such as age, salary, satisfaction level, performance rating, and attrition status (whether they left the company or not). The data is stored in a CSV file named `employee_attrition.csv`.

## Project Structure

- `employee_attrition_analysis.py`: Python script for analyzing employee attrition data.
- `employee_attrition.csv`: CSV file containing the employee attrition data.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

bashCopy code

`git clone https://github.com/your_username/employee-attrition-analysis.git`

2. Navigate to the project directory:

bashCopy code

`cd employee-attrition-analysis`

3. Install the required libraries:

Copy code

`pip install pandas matplotlib`

4. Run the Python script:

Copy code

`python employee_attrition_analysis.py`

## Results

Upon running the Python script, various plots will be generated to visualize insights derived from the analysis, including histograms of numerical features, bar plots comparing attrition status and other features, comparison of average salaries between employees who left and those who stayed, and a pie chart showing reasons for attrition.
