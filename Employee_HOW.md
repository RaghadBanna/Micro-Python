1. **Importing Libraries:**
    
    - We import the necessary libraries at the beginning of the code:
        - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
        - `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.
2. **Loading Data:**
    
    - We load the employee attrition data from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame using the `pd.read_csv()` function.
    - Ensure that you have a CSV file named `'employee_attrition.csv'` in the same directory as your Python script. Adjust the filename if it's different.
3. **Data Preprocessing:**
    
    - We perform basic data preprocessing to check for missing values in the dataset using the `isnull().sum()` function.
    - The result (`missing_values`) displays the number of missing values for each column.
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    
    - We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
    - We analyze the distribution of numerical features (e.g., age, salary, satisfaction level, performance rating) using histograms.
    - We analyze the relationship between attrition status and other features using bar plots.
    - We compare average salaries between employees who left and those who stayed using bar plots.
    - We visualize reasons for attrition using a pie chart.
5. **Data Visualization:**
    
    - We use Matplotlib for data visualization.
    - Matplotlib's functions are used to create histograms, bar plots, and pie charts to visualize different aspects of the employee attrition data.
6. **Output:**
    
    - The code generates various plots to visualize the data and insights derived from the analysis.

You can run this code in your local Python environment by copying it into a Python script file (e.g., `employee_attrition_analysis.py`) and ensuring that you have the necessary CSV file containing your employee attrition data. Once executed, the code will display the generated plots in separate windows or inline, depending on your Python environment setup.

Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas` and `matplotlib`) before running the script. Additionally, you can upload this script to your GitHub repository along with the CSV file to share your analysis with others.
